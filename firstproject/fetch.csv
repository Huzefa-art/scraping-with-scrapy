She utilizes fitness and meditation to help in the healing process.,Based in New York City, DJ Ria has spun for A-List artists such as Nas, J. Cole All-Star Weekend, Diddy, Bryson Tiller, Young Thug, Talib Kweli, Trey Songz, Salt n Pepper and La La Anthony (Denim Line).,, a new virtual fitness platform featuring top instructors and workouts from around the world, is launching its first-ever live event series, Move For Mental Health, this winter.,Kicking off on Saturday, November 20, in partnership with iHeart Radio & Gympass, , will run for six weekends, inspiring thousands to move while raising funds for mental health causes. Taught by notable instructors from around the world, the series will feature everything from HIIT to guided meditation, with surprise visits each weekend from special guests and musicians.,The class lineup includes prominent instructors and DJs, such as Revenge Body trainer Corey Calliet, Tokyo Gold medalist Stefanie Dolson, celebrity instructor Jenna Willis, US soccer player Kealia Watt, Jesse Israel and Jackie Cantwell from The Big Quiet and many more. Every workout will include a selection of superb wellness giveaways, too, with products from brands including Cheribundi, Manscaped and Provenance Meals. Tickets for each class will benefit key nonprofits and community organizations, such as Athlete Ally and Cheatcode, working to destigmatize mental health and promote equity in fitness, wellness and athletic communities.,After launching Recess.tv at the height of the pandemic in 2020, the company’s founder and CEO Nate Jewell hopes Move For Mental Health will provide Recess.tv with a chance to genuinely give back and support the community during the holidays which are notoriously mentally taxing. Since the company’s start, Recess.tv has seen a YOY increase of +1500% in virtual class signups and a 400% increase in instructor growth. Move For Mental Health will serve as a moment to both celebrate and expand upon Recess.tv’s mission to improve mind-body health for all.,""I love how accessible workout routines have become, but the rise of on-demand fitness has created a gap in the total health benefits that digital fitness can truly offer. In a rush to give people premium hardware and Hollywood level production, we've lost that crucial sense of community and personal touch that nourishes our mental well-being. Beyond physical results, our focus with Recess is to create a place that routinely feeds your mental, spiritual, and nutritional health,” Jewell says.,Each virtual class in the series is $25, with additional opportunities to donate and support every week. Information on the lineup, registration and class schedules can be viewed at recess.tv/move."
